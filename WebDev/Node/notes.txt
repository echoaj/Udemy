A common pattern in Node when requiring folders is to have an index.html in the folder
you are requiring.  And inside index.html, require all other files, put them in an array
and export them all. 

package.json is a file that is included in every node module that contain things like
dependencies, authors, bugs, description, and more.  It technically is not required
bit it should always be there.  npm init to make package.js that conforms to template/standard
you should follow.  Now that we have a package.json we won't get a warning when installing Node modules.
Now package.json contains new node and version you installed.  Nothing in package.json will affect your code.

Don't include Node modules when uploading code to GitHub.
In .gitignore type: node_modules/*

Run npm install or npm i to install all dependencies in package.json.
Run npm init to create package.json
Run npm init -y to skip questions when creating package.json
