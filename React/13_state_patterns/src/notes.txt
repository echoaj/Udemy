In React, you want to try to put as little data in state as possible
Litmust text: os x change?  If not don't make it part of the state.  Maybe it should be a prop
Limust test:  is x already captured by some other value Y in state or props?  Derive it from there instead.

Bad Example of state design:
    this.state{
        fname: "matt",
        lname: "Johnson",
        bday:  "July 19",
        age: 25,
        mage: 'irate',
    }

fixed Example of state design:
    console.log(this.props);
    {
        fname: "matt",
        lname: "Johnson",
        bday:  "July 19",
        age: 25,
    }

    console.log(this.state){
        mood: 'insane'
    }

Where should state live?
In parent, we want to support "downward data flow".  Also makes it easier to debug.
